This repository provides a comprehensive guide and scripts to help CARC (High-Performance Computing at the University of Southern California) users efficiently run Alphafold for protein structure predictions. The guide is specifically designed for USC students and all CARC users, especially those affiliated with the MEB (Molecular and Environmental Biology) department.

## Features
- **Optimized Code for Alphafold:** Learn how to write the best possible code for running Alphafold on CARC.
- **Batch Protein Structure Predictions:** Includes scripts for running multiple predictions using array jobs, allowing you to easily handle large-scale protein analysis.
- **Future Updates:** Scripts for managing outputs and potentially visualizing protein structures will be added.

## Installation

To use the scripts in this repository, you can either clone the repository or copy the necessary code directly into your project.

### Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KambizKalhor/your-repo-name.git
```

### Dependencies



### Usage
Running Alphafold on CARC
Use the provided scripts to submit jobs efficiently, especially for batch predictions with arrays.
Example usage:

```bash
sbatch run_alphafold_array.slurm
```
### Customization
Feel free to modify the scripts to suit your protein prediction needs. You can adjust batch sizes, memory allocations, and other computational parameters as needed.
